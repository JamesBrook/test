 <h1>Research interests</h1>

<p>My main research interests centre around issues of crime and punishment with a particular focus on crime prevention and community safety on one hand and prisons and penal policy on the other. </p>

<p>I have conducted research on armed robbery, shoplifting, and the use of CCTV cameras, disorder and anti-social behaviour. In relation to punishment, I have conducted research on diversion from custody, developing alternatives to prison and evaluating the use of community based sanctions. In addition I have conducted research on prostitution and sex trafficking involving comparative studies across Europe and more detailed studies in the UK.</p>

<h2>Current</h2>

<p>At the moment I am involved in five research projects:</p>

<ul class="researchList">
<li>An examination of women exiting prostitution, which is being undertaken in collaboration with Eaves Housing for Women and is funded by the National Lottery. The aim of this project is to examine and understand the process of desistance and the process of leaving prostitution.</li>
<li>A piece of research to evaluate a community-based alternative to custody for women in Glasgow. This project involves an examination of the effectiveness in providing a community-based form of support for women offenders. This project was funded by the Scottish Office.</li>
<li>The third project has a similar focus and is based in Northern Ireland and funded by the Northern Ireland Office. It involves an examination of approbation centered diversion programme for women in the Belfast area.</li>
<li>A project which focuses on sex trafficking in Scotland and is funded by the EHRC. It examines the dynamics of sex trafficking and is based on interviews with victims and practitioners.</li>
<li>A project also based in Scotland involving a strategic review of prostitution policy and practice in Glasgow over the last decade. It is funded by Glasgow City Council and is based on extensive research with women involved in indoor and street prostitution, practitioners and policy makers.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Past</h2>  

<p>During the 1990s, I carried out a piece of research on armed robbery and the findings were published in a book entitled “Armed Robbery” (Willan 2002)</p>

<h2>Supervision</h2> 

<p>I am currently supervising six PhD students. If you have a proposal in my areas of interest and you are interesting in studying at the University of Kent, please email me to discuss further.</p>
